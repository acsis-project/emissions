These zip files contain ascii tables with annual or monthly emitted totals (in kg of species).

Files named `*_combined.csv` contain the emitted total from all sectors. For most species a breakdown of the data from various sectors is available. At very least a listing of contributions from the anthropogenic sectors, from biomass burning and from biogenic processes is available.

v1 refers to the first batch of emissions files used for the ACSIS control runs.
