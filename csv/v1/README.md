## Emissions Timeseries Data

These zip files contain ascii tables with annual or monthly emitted totals (in kg of species).

Files named `*_combined.csv` (contain within the zip archives) contain the emitted totals from all sectors. For most species a breakdown of the data from various sectors is available. At the very least a listing of contributions from the anthropogenic sectors, from biomass burning and from biogenic processes is available.

v1 refers to the first batch of emissions files used for the ACSIS control runs.
